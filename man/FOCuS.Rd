\usage{
FOCuS(datasource, thres, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{datasource}{Either a data generating function, for an online analysis, or a vector of observations, for offline testing. See \strong{Details}.}

\item{thres}{The threshold for a detection.}

\item{...}{Other additional arguments passed to the method.}

\item{mu0}{The value of the pre-change mean, if known. Defaulting to \code{NA}. When \code{NA}, the pre-change-mean unknown recursion will be employed. Pre-change mean is therefore estimated iteratively.}

Fast Online Changepoint Detection via Functional Pruning CUSUM statistics
}
\details{
FOCuS employs S4 method dispatch based on the data source to perform either an online or offline analysis. For running the algorithm online, \code{datasource} requires an object of class \code{'function'}. For running the algorithm offline, useful for testing purposes, the method expects an object of class \code{'vector'}.
