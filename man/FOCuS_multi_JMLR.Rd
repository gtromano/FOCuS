\title{A Simple High-dimensional Extension of FOCuS}
\usage{
FOCuS_multi_JMLR(datasource, thres, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{datasource}{A matrix of dimension \code{p x n}, containing \code{p} sequences of length \code{n}.}

\item{thres}{The Thresholds for the max and the sum of the FOCuS sequences. This needs to be in the form of positive numeric vector or length 2.}

\item{...}{Other parameters as described in \link{FOCuS}.}
}
\value{
Returns an s3 object of class FOCuSout where:
\describe{
\item{\code{$t}}{is the stopping time at the detection.}
\item{\code{$stats}}{A matrix containing the FOCuS statistics from each data stream.}
\item{\code{$maxs}}{the max across the various data stream at each iteration.}
\item{\code{$sums}}{the sum across the various data stream at each iteration.}
}
}
\description{
A simple implementation of the \link{FOCuS} to deal with multivariate, high-dimensional sequences. 
This is achieved by taking both the maximum and sum of the \link{FOCuS} statistics across data streams.
